# Multiphase-Flow-Modeling

## About the Project

This repository contains the Group 13 term project for modeling multiphase flow systems. The project focuses on simulating and analyzing the behavior of multiple interacting fluid phases in various engineering and scientific applications. The goal is to provide accurate and efficient computational models to better understand complex multiphase flow phenomena.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Modeling**: Includes models for gas-liquid, liquid-liquid, and gas-solid interactions.
- **Customizable Simulations**: Easily configure parameters to simulate different flow conditions.
- **Visualization Tools**: Integrated tools for visualizing flow dynamics and phase interactions.
- **Scalable Codebase**: Designed for high-performance computing and scalability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
